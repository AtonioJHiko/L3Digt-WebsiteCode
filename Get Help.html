                <h4>School Counsellors</h4>
                <p>Your counselor’s a private, skilled person who knows how to help. They’ll hear you out - no matter what - whether it’s pressure, home stuff, worry, or goals ahead. To reach out, just shoot a short message: "Can we set up a quick 15-min talk? I’ve been stressed lately."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="support-detail nurse-info">
                <h4>School Nurse / Health Team</h4>
                <p>The nurse helps when your emotions turn into body issues - like headaches, no sleep, or constant tiredness. Since they see how feelings affect health, they’ll suggest real steps that fit your situation. Try saying this: “Lately I’ve had tension in my head and can’t rest well at night… maybe from pressure. Is now a good time to chat?”</p>

                <h4>Trusted Adults (Teachers, Deans, Coaches)</h4>
                <p>A safe grown-up’s just someone you get along with easily. Not necessarily a therapist - still, they could give real help or just hear you out. When asking, pick a calm moment and keep it light: “Things’ve been tough now and then… think you’d have a few minutes to chat?”</p>

            <p>Remember: You matter - putting in the work counts. Looking after your thoughts matters just like looking after your physical health does. Staying safe and keeping things personal? That’s key. Every expert or support line here knows how to protect your details, except if there's a real-time threat to you or others.</p>
