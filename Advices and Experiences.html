                <h3>Why Stories Matter</h3>
                <p>Sometimes, the hardest part of dealing with tough emotions is feeling like you’re the only one going through it. This page is here to change that. 
                <br>Real talk: Your experience is valid, and you are not alone.</p>
                <p>When students share their experiences—whether it's managing school stress, dealing with anxiety, or learning how to ask for help—it creates a powerful connection. Reading their short, anonymized stories can offer you a fresh perspective, practical tips that actually work, and the encouragement you need to take your own next steps toward feeling better.</p>

                <h3>Maya, 16 (on Overwhelm)</h3>
                <p class="story-text">"My anxiety used to spike during exam week. I felt completely frozen. My breakthrough wasn't a magic cure, but a simple routine: 15 minutes of focusing on one subject, followed by a 5-minute stretching break. It felt less scary because I wasn't trying to do everything at once."</p>

                <p class="story-text">"I always felt guilty about needing alone time. I thought I had to be 'on' for my friends 24/7. Now, I schedule one night a week to just listen to music or build something without any social pressure. It truly makes me a better friend the rest of the time."</p>

                <p class="story-text">"The scariest part was admitting I needed help. I thought everyone would judge me. I ended up just sending a text to my school counselor saying, 'Yeah, I need to talk to someone, anyone, and honestly I don't know why.' It was the hardest thing, but my life changed after that one text."</p>
