          <h3>Understand Your Feelings</h3>
          <p>Now and then, life feels confusing. Pressure, worry, being on your own - each person handles these differently. Here’s a place/page for you to check in with yourself: figure out what you're feeling, dig into the reasons behind it, yet also learn ways to deal. Once you get clearer about your emotions, things start feeling more manageable.</p>
          <button onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Read More</button>
          <span class="more-text">
              Explore what you’re feeling, why it happens, and how to take small steps that make a big difference. Learning about yourself is powerful — and you don’t have to do it alone.

          <h3>Real Stories. Real Hope.</h3>
          <p>You're not alone in this. Listen to peers just like you who've dealt with stress or trying to fit in, too much online, and just stuff that hits close to home. If you need advice, a real-life moment, or simply someone who understands - you’ll find it here. Sharing opens doors, helps us heal, builds grit.</p>
          <button onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Read More</button>
          <span class="more-text">
              Read honest stories about overcoming anxiety, school stress, and tough emotions. Their experiences show that healing isn’t perfect — but it’s possible, and it’s worth it.

          <button onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Read More</button>
          <span class="more-text">
